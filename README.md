## Topic

Influences of performance in algorithms

## Introduction

### Background Information

### Research question

Are optimisations that have a time-space trade-off more effective than optimisations that don't have time-space trade-offs?

### Hypothesis

Programs that trade space complexity with time complexity will have a greater performance but at the cost of greater memory usage.

## Method

### Materials

### Procedure

We will analyze the time and memory usage of many different algorithms while using different optimising techniques to see how they differ.

We will write the implementations of many types of algorithms, both fast and slow, and determine the optimising techniques to see how they changed the space and time complexity.  

Types of algorithms
* Sorting algorithms
* Searching algorithms

Optimising techniques include:
* Divide and Conquer
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy
* Hashing

Ways of determining result:
* Space time complexity analysis
* Benchmarking
