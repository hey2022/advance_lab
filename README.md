## Topic

Computational Complexity Theory

## Introduction

### Background Information

### Research question

Is the computational complexity of an algorithm an accurate representation of an algorithm's performance?

### Hypothesis

Computational complexity is accurate to a certain extent, but benchmarking will give more realistic results.

## Method

### Materials

### Procedure

We will write the implementations of many types of algorithms, both fast and slow, and determine to see how big O notation and benchmarked results differ.

Types of algorithms
* Sorting algorithms
* Searching algorithms

Ways of determining result:
* Space time complexity analysis
* Benchmarking
